# Scraping-Data-from-a-Real-Website
This is my first project, and itâ€™s about scraping data from a real website! I used the QS World University Rankings page on Wikipedia as an example.

Using Python, I was able to extract all the table data related to QS world university rankings. The first step was choosing a target website, which, in my case, was the Wikipedia page for QS World University Rankings. You can choose any site you like as your target.

My goal was to gather all the ranking-related data, and to achieve this, I used the bs4 library to import BeautifulSoup, which helped me collect the HTML content from the webpage. Once I had the data, I used pandas to organize it into a DataFrame. From there, it was easy to export all the data I needed from the website.


If you need more info just email(nabilhuda191@gmail.com) me for any help you need, and check the main.py file that is the whole project!

Thank you for you attention!
