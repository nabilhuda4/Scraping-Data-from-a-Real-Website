# Scraping-Data-from-a-Real-Website
This is my first project! This project is about Scraping Data from a Real Website! I used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QS_World_University_Rankings website as an example!
And with using Python i was able to get all the table data related to QS world ranking universities!
